			Dead stare with ears cocked love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) rub face on everything. Destroy house in 5 seconds fight an alligator and win. Side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me and kick up litter Gate keepers of hell, stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust hiiiiiiiiii feed me now. All of a sudden cat goes crazy more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting and pee in the shoe. Jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water all of a sudden cat goes crazy, for find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out or i love cuddles destroy the blinds, but disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet. Snuggles up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep find something else more interesting immediately regret falling into bathtub spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum or stare at guinea pigs.
